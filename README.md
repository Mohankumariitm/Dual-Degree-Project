# Dual-Degree-Project

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) remains of a great importance due to its substantial role in the field of signal processing and imagery. In this report, multiple designs of 8 point FFT  algorithm is proposed. The developed architecture was implemented using an FPGA . Though, the material resources of the FPGA are limited, particularly the integrated DSP blocks, different approaches are used during the Verilog description with the aim to reduce the necessary number of LUTs. The experimental validation was done using ISIM simulation tool, where the numerical synthesis and the post and route described in Verilog was realized using ISE Design Suite 14.7. The FFT modules of all the implementations were tested using a python script with various corner input test vectors.
